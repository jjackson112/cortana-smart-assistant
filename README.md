# cortana-smart-assistant

Cortana is a Python-based smart assistant built to reinforce Python concepts through a practical, real-word style project. 

This is an evolution of an older personal assistant project I completed during my full-stack program - it's a skills refresher as I become more adept at Python and move on to larger, full-stack projects, like CaseFlow.

## Features
- Command-based interaction via the reed–eval loop
- Modular architecture using Python modules
- File handling (JSON / text files) for persistent data
- Dictionary-based command routing
- Object-oriented design with classes and methods
- Error handling and input validation
- CRUD implemented
- persistent storage and timestamped entries

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Standard Python libraries (json, datetime, os, etc.)
- Virtual environment (`venv`)
- Git & GitHub for version control
